The Paradox Network is Ethereum's version of Bitcoin's Lightning Network, enabling fast, cheap, scalable payments.

 

1.	SCALABILITY - Off-chain payment channels capable of millions to billions of transactions per second across the network.
2. TRANSACTIONS - Lightning-fast payments without worrying about block confirmation times.
3.	COMISSION FEES - By transacting and settling off-blockchain, the Paradox Network allows for exceptionally low fees, which allows for emerging use cases such as instant micropayments.
4.	TRUST - The Paradox Network is a technology invented to extend the capabilities of Ethereum's blockchain. Payment channels create the new model of trust, extending and improving upon the properties of Ethereum.
